# Celebal_AnaVerse - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my participation entry for the **Celebal_AnaVerse** Kaggle-style competition. Though I did not clear the round, the project gave me valuable hands-on experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a basic predictive model pipeline.

## 📁 Files Included

- `train.csv`: The training dataset provided in the competition.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset on which predictions were to be made.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample format for submission.
- `submission.csv`: My final submitted predictions for the test data.
- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing my complete workflow including:
  - Data Loading
  - Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model Training and Evaluation
  - Generating Submission File

## 📌 Objective

The goal was to create a predictive model using the given training data and generate predictions for the test dataset in the required format for submission.

## 🔍 What I Learned

I gained practical insights into:
- Understanding the structure and flow of a real-world ML problem
- Handling train-test splits effectively
- Feature engineering and transformations
- Working with submission formats in competitions
- Evaluating models and improving prediction quality

## 🧠 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Every competition is an opportunity to learn, and this one helped reinforce my understanding of the ML lifecycle. I look forward to participating in more such challenges in the future!
